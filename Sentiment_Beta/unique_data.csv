Might pay off but it is not a short-term play. | In increase in interest rates maybe what hit the price of these dividend stocks. Many income investors seek short bonds such as T-bill funds like SGOV that pays a dividend of about 5%. Rates probably won't come down any time soon, so all three of PFE, VZ and BTI may refuse to go anywhere even if the company sustains the same dividend amount per year.

If your plans need dividend income or just inc | VZ has a high dividend because they are a low-growth company. So they have to reward shareholders through dividends because they are not being rewarded through price growth.

Their growth could be insane | How tf is VZ value trap when dividends are fully covered. | VZ has dividends covered by fcf  | I think TMUS will eat VZ for lunch. Many ex VZ customers will never come back. | I think there is concern each might have to cut its dividend, and doing so would make the share price drop. To buy now is to wager that no dividend cut is coming, and not many investors are willing to make that bet right now.  I did make that bet on VZ, buying a small position last week. Might work out, might not. We’ll see. | Oh I didn't realize VZ was Verizon. They actually tanked last year, I believe mostly due to hype about lead cables health hazard concerns. I haven't kept up with it, but if they are out of the woods with that, then in theory Verizon is a company one might consider ""too big to fail"" and that opportunistically buying at a time when it's down due to bad press can actually be a good move.

How do I put money from my SCHD stock into my NVDA stock?,"I don't know if you're ready for this but here goes... you're gonna have to sell some $SCHD and then, believe it or not, buy some $NVDA. | He can always wait til it happens randomly by a cosmic ray that goes through all the servers where his position is stored and changes the specific bits changing SCHD to NVDA. | I thought so. It’s as simple as that? Just sell some SCHD and then buy some NVDA? | You will have to wait for your funds to clear. That should be instant if your $ is in brokerage. If it’s in a retirement account, it takes 2 days (soon to be 1). Until you learn a lot more about in, you should stay away from individual stocks and buy funds (etf or mutual) with hundreds of companies.
